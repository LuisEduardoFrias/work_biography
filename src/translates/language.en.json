	"introduction-p1": "My introduction to the world of computer science began at the age of 15, during a '<b>Computer Support</b>' course while in high school. This course gave me an overview of computing, networks, and systems, sparking my interest in this technological world, and longing to obtain a <b>Computer Engineering</b> degree in the future.",
	"introduction-p2": "At the <i>Prof. Juan Bosch Polytechnic Institute</i>, during my third year of high school, I began to delve into programming with subjects such as programming with <i>Delphi</i>, web development with <i>Dreamweaver</i>, and gate logic. Although I liked programming, I felt that <i>Delphi and Dreamweaver</i> were ambiguous technologies, I preferred traditional web with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and exploring alternatives like Visual Basic.",
	"challenges-section": "Challenges and Decisions",
	"challenges-p1": "Upon finishing high school, a teacher told me about an opportunity for a scholarship at ITLA (Technological Institute of the Americas) in the '<i>Software Development</i>' career, this opportunity vanished due to personal circumstances. Later, the death of my father and the economic downturn in my family led me to focus on UASD (Autonomous University of Santo Domingo) in order to fulfill my desire to become a <b>Computer Engineer</b>, a desire that waned when I discovered that the career had changed its title from an '<b>Engineering</b>' to a '<b>Bachelor's Degree</b>', the disappointment was great, but I decided to continue.",
	"challenges-p2": "In the end, the experience that awaited me at UASD was difficult, with the difficulty involved in studying there, the disappointment I already had about the career, the introduction of an extensive 2-year basic cycle, and the need to work, led me to never attend, I abandoned all hope.<br /> Finally, a light appeared, thank God, one day I ran into a high school friend, she was studying at ITSC (Higher Technical Community Institute), an institute just as good as ITLA, she guided me and explained how everything was there, she restored my hopes. It was then that I found my path as a '<b>Higher Technician in Software Development</b>'.",
	"self-taught-section": "The Self-Taught Path",
	"self-taught-p1": "By mid-2019, I already had my first job as a programmer and finished my technical degree at ITSC in 2020. I began to learn self-taught, I absorbed information and gained experience very quickly, and in a short time, I had already gotten my 2nd job and doubled my income, a stable job where I could grow even more. On a friend's recommendation, I was contacted for what was my 3rd job and thus doubled my income again, good work environment, even greater growth and development capabilities, again my desire to acquire a university degree (<b>Engineer</b>) vanished. I valued more the knowledge and ability I had acquired after the technical degree and continuing as self-taught. I consider myself a '<b>Computer Engineer</b>' in constant learning.",
	"self-taught-p2": "Currently in mid-2025, the desire to obtain a university degree has resurfaced. Also, English has become my second great goal or who knows maybe they will switch places.",
